# Travelling Salesman Problem Project

# Introduction
This project utilises The Branch and Bound Method, The Nearest Neighbor Method and brute force in order to solve the travelling salesman problem. These methods have been implemented in both Java and Python.

# Running the program
Python: No special requirements for executing code

Java:
Java running the program"void main (String[]args)" The Runner of the program is the program is the 
as they have to be opened from “RunBranchAndBound”,” RunBruteForce” and “RunNearestNeighbor” for each different way respectively. 

For the running of each different method to work, the files with the are needed to execute the code.

For the runners to function properly they need their specific code such as ‘BranchAndBound’, ‘BruteForce’, and ‘NearestNeighborTSP’ for the runners above.
the city class is essential for all the methods to work because it does the coordinates handling for the program. 


**Tests**: To run python test, dowload the file and then on command line access the file

      cd "Path of Tests.py"

Make sure pandas is installed in the python environment, if not

      pip install pandas

Then run the test

      python Tests.py
